                    	<h3>Christianity</h3>
                        <p>The apple has traditionally been identified as the "Forbidden Fruit" in the Garden of Eden.  However, this distinction may have been the result of Renaissance painters adding elements of Greek mythology into biblical scenes.  The "Forbidden Fruit" became an apple under the influence of the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides.  Consequently, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, and the fall of man and sin.</p>

                        <p>The apple was considered, in ancient Greece, to be sacred to Aphrodite, and to throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love.</p>

                        <p>New York City is often called "The Big Apple." The term was coined by touring jazz musicians and horse racers of the 1920s who used the slang expression "apple" for any town or city. Therefore, to play New York City is to play the big time &mdash; The Big Apple.</p>

                            <li>Preheat oven to 425&deg;F (220&deg;C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
                            <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
