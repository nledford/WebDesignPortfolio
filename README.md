# Web Design Portfolio

This repository contains websites I created as assignments for my community college's web design/Adobe Dreamweaver class.  Each website was centered around a particular theme, e.g., a travel destination or a favorite musical group.  All images used in these web sites were not copyrighted with the exception of images used in the MUTEMATH web site.
